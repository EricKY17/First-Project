            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Let me introcude myself first: My name is Eric Kenzo Yamada, I am from Brazil and am 32 years old. You can say I am one of the newest enthusiast of learning and searching about programming. Throw me something about it and I wil devour it within seconds!<br /> 
                I really started to like about this whole world and it is so satisfying to see things start being created by something I just wrote sitting in front of my personal computer.<br />
                I am really excited to be challenged by what my future as programmer is waiting for me as I am looking forward to keep learning and evolving my skills to become a better professional.
